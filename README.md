# uwu-malware

[fastest uwuifier in the west](https://github.com/Daniel-Liu-c0deb0t/uwu)... now implemented as a (joke) malware!

## FAQ
### You've ruined my whole 5000 word report!!! How can I stop this nonsense???
The killswitch/hotkey to quit the process is the "Print Screen" button... but don't tell this to that friend that you're trying to prank!

### How is this possible???
I'm just using the library - it's the fastest uwuifier in the west! What can I say, other than to check out Daniel Liu's [uwuify](https://crates.io/crates/uwuify) crate. His [Github](https://github.com/Daniel-Liu-c0deb0t/uwu) also documents alot.
